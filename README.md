# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project.

In this project, I have used HTML and CSS to produce a website that looks closely like the old Twitter website.

The project functions in a way that forces every user to first create an account or login, if the user has an account. The user has a photo to show on his profile and a cover image that shows on his profile. When the user doesn't provide an image, then the first letter of the users username is displayed. Also when the user has no cover image, the user's fullname and username is displayed instead. 

Logged in the user see a timeline with only opinions of the ones he follows and his own opinions.

There is another view for the user profile, that shows a cover image above the specific user opinions and profile information on the right.

The functionality to follow/unfollow is very intuitive. '+' buttons to follow, '-' button to unfollow a user.

A user (when logged in) can either only like or dislike an opinion
